NeuralNetwork.getNumericGradient(Instance instance): For this method you will need to approximate the gradient using the finite difference method described in the backwards pass lecture notes.

NeuralNetwork.backwardPass(Instance instance): For this method you will need to perform a backwards pass on the neural network to calculate the gradient. 

NeuralNetwork.getGradient(Instance instance): This will return the gradient from the backwards pass.

NeuralNetwork.getNumericGradient(List<instance> instances): This returns the numeric gradient approximation for a group of instances at once.

NeuralNetwork.getGradient(List<instance> instances): This returns the overall gradient calculated by doing forward and backwards passes for each instance.

Node.propagateBackward(): This propagates the node's delta back through its incoming edges.

Edge.propagateBackward(): This propagates the edge's delta back through to its input node.

You should complete these and make sure all the tests in PA12Tests.java run and pass successfully.




Programming Assignment 1 is 15% of your final grade, and PA1-2 is 35% of that. It will be graded of 5 points as follows:

(1 point) getNumericGradient(Instance instance) works.

(3 points) getGradient(Instance instance) and backwardPass(Instance instance) works.

(1 point) getNumericGradient(List<instance> instances) and getGradient(List<instance> instances) work.</instance></instance></instance></instance>
