pa1/compile.sh - This is a simple script to compile the java code in this programming assignment. You can run it from the command line with sh compile.sh when you're in the pa1 directory.

pa1/data/DataSet.java - This class is used to load and use training/testing data from text files. It creates an ArrayList of instances.

pa1/data/Instance.java - The Instance class represents a single line of a data set. A line in a data set will have a set of expected output values for a set of input values.

pa1/dataset/xor.txt - This is the preliminary data file we'll be using to train our neural networks with. It contains the 4 instances of an XOR gate, a simple benchmark problem we can use to make sure our code is working correctly. We will add more datasets in PA1-3.

pa1/network/ActivationType.java - This is an enum which is used to determine which activation function a node in the network should use.

pa1/network/Edge.java - This represents an edge in a neural network.

pa1/network/NeuralNetwork.java - This is used to create and train neural networks.

pa1/network/NeuralNetworkException.java - Any problems that happen in the neural network code will throw a NeuralNetworkException. These are also used to validate the unit tests.

pa1/network/Node.java - This is used to represent a Node in a neural network.

pa1/network/NodeType.java - This is a simple enum used to represent the different possible types of nodes in the neural network (INPUT, HIDDEN or OUTPUT).

pa1/util/Log.java - This is a simple logging class to help you better print out messages to the screen for debugging, testing and actual use. You can write messages to the log at varying levels and specify which messages get printed to the terminal on the command line with the -DLOG_LEVEL=<level> system property.

pa1/BasicTests.java - This contains a basic set of unit tests to validate that the neural network code and data set code is working correctly. These should all work initially and should not be broken by any updates you make in completing the programming assignment. You can run this (after compiling) with java -DLOG_LEVEL=info BasicTests to run these tests to verify they work.

pa1/PA11Tests.java - This contains another set of unit tests which you will need to make sure work to verify that your implemented code for this assignment is working correctly. You can run this (after compiling) with java -DLOG_LEVEL=info PA11Tests to run these tests and see which do not work. They test both the NeuralNetwork.forwardPass method as well as the NeuralNetwork.connectNodes method.




A big part of this assignment is to get comfortable and understand the code you will be working with. Please be sure to read through all the java code and take a look at the xor.txt data file. The code has a number of comments which should help you understand what is going on. There is more to the code but we will get to that for the other parts of Programming Assignment 1.




Your task for the first part of programming assignment one is to complete two aspects of a NeuralNetwork within this framework. Programming Assignment 1 is 15% of your final grade, and Part 1 is 25% of that. &nbsp;This will be graded out of 5 points. There is also potential to get 1 point bonus (which will be approximately +1% to your final grade) in this part.




1. (2 points) Complete the NeuralNetwork.connectNodes method. You will need to complete this to pass the first set of unit tests in PA11Tests.java.

2. (3 points) Complete the NeuralNetwork.forwardPass method. This will include completing a few submethods (e.g., Node.applyTanh and Node.applySigmoid). Make sure that you use Node.propagateForward as part of your NeuralNetwork.forwardPass method. You can add additional methods if needed. You will need to complete this to pass the third set of unit tests in PA11Tests.java.

BONUS (5%): Get connectNodes and forwardPass to work with layer skipping connections. When complete the second and fourth set of unit tests in PA11Tests.java should work.

In completing the above, none of your changes should break the unit tests in BasicTests.java. The methods you need to complete are marked with TODO in a comment, so you can find them and the line they are on with the following command (run from within the pa1 directory):

grep -n 'TODO' ./*/*.java</level>
