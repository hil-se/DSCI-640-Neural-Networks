PA2-4 assignment is focused on implementing gradient boosting and scaling, as well as an LSTM cell.

Programming Assignment 2 is 15% of your final grade, and Part 4 is 25% of that. This will be graded out of 4 points, with potential for 8 additional bonus points.




1. (1 point) Implement gradient boosting and scaling (in GradientDescent.java).

2. (3 points) Complete the LSTMNode.java code. This will involve implementing both the propagateForward and propagateBackward methods. You can add extra fields if needed (but I was able to complete with just the ones in the provided LSTMNode.java code), so you shouldn't need any more. You will also need to implement the initializeRandomly methods, which will initialize all weights and biases for the node and input edges (don't forget to add 1 to the forget gate bias).

3. (5% each) Implement your own of: GRUNode, MGUNode, UGRNNNode or DeltaNode, along with a PA24TestsGRU, PA24TestsMGU, PA24TestsUGRNN or PA24TestsDelta (which would be an updated version of PA24Tests except for your chosen memory cell). You will need to update PA21Tests around lines 91 and 153 to properly calculate expected number of weights for networks with your memory cell.

In completing the above, none of your changes should break the unit tests in BasicTests.java, PA21Tests.java, PA22Tests.java, or PA23Tests.java. You should be able to successfully complete all the PA24TestsLSTM.java. Additionally you should be able to successfully run the GradientDescent.java program for any network and data type, example usage and parameters:

java GradientDescent flights_small LSTM jordan kaiming stochastic 2 l2_norm 50 0.0 0.005 0.5 0.05 1.0 10

java GradientDescent penn_small LSTM jordan kaiming stochastic 2 softmax 5 0.0 0.005 0.5 0.05 1.0 48

The methods you need to complete are marked with TODO in a comment, so you can find them and the line they are on with the following command (run from within the pa24 directory):

grep -n 'TODO' ./*/*.java
