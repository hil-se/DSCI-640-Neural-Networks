PA2-2 will be focused on completing the backward pass for the character sequence data.

Programming Assignment 2 is 15% of your final grade, and Part 2 is 25% of that. This will be graded out of 5 points.

1. (2 point) Complete the propagateBackward methods in Edge, RecurrentEdge and RecurrentNode, along with backwardPass in RecurrentNeuralNetwork.

2. (1 point) Complete the initializeRandomly method in RecurrentNeuralNetwork along with the helper methods in RecurrentNode: initializeWeightsAndBiasXavier and initializeWeightsAndBiasKaiming.

2. (2 points) Complete the calculateAccuracy and getNumericGradients methods in RecurrentNeuralNetwork.

In completing the above, none of your changes should break the unit tests in BasicTests.java or PA21Tests.java. You should be able to successfully complete all the PA22Tests.java. The methods you need to complete are marked with TODO in a comment, so you can find them and the line they are on with the following command (run from within the pa23 directory):

grep -n 'TODO' ./*/*.java
