For this part of the assignment you'll need to implement normalization for the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets,  random weight initialization (kaiming and xavier), the forward pass through a CNN, and construct your own LeNet-5 CNN.

Programming Assignment 3 is 15% of your final grade, and Part 1 is 33% of that.  This will be graded out of 6 points. You will need to implement the following:

1. (1 point) getChannelAvgs and getChannelStdDevs in ImageDataSet. These are used to implement normalization.

2. (1 point) initializeWeightsAndBiasXavier and initializeWeightsAndBiasKaiming in ConvolutionalNode.java.

3. (2 points) forwardPass in ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork.forwardPass, and propagateForward in ConvolutionalNode, ConvolutionalEdge, and PoolingEdge.

4 (2 points) createLeNet5 in ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork.

You can verify that your forward pass code is working by using PA31Tests.java and PA31TestCNNs.java.
